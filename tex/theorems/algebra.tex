\begin{technique}[Some Useful Identities]
    \label{teq: algidentities}
    For any real numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$, the following identities hold.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca$.
        \item $(a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) = abc + ab + bc + ca + a + b + c + 1$.
        \item $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{technique}

\begin{technique}[Mathematical Induction]
    \label{teq: induction}
    % Insert falling dominoes
    Sometimes, while proving something, we may notice that a problem can be reduced to a smaller version of the same problem. In those cases, we can use mathematical induction. A proof using induction generally consists of two parts. Suppose that we are trying to prove a statement $P$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item We first show that $P(i)$ is true for some natural number $i$, usually 0 or 1. This is called the base case. 
        \item We then show that if $P(n)$ is true, than $P(n + 1)$ must also be true. This is called the inductive step.
    \end{enumerate}
    If we can do both of these steps, then we can conclude that the statement $P$ is true for all natural numbers $n \geq i$. It is easy to see why this holds: from step 1, $P(i)$ is true, and from step 2, $P(i + 1)$ must be true. Since $P(i + 1)$ is true, by step 2 again, $P(i + 2)$ is also true, and so on. This is often illustrated by the classic example of falling dominoes. Usually, the second step is a lot more important and difficult to prove than the first one. 

    There are also many other variants of induction. One important and generally more useful version is `strong induction', where we assume in step 2 that $P(k)$ is true for all $i \leq k \leq n$, rather than just $P(n)$. Another version which is used less often is `forward - backward induction' which is described below as technique \ref{teq: f.b.induction}.
\end{technique}

\begin{technique}[Forward - Backward Induction]
    \label{teq: f.b.induction}
    This is a rarely used variant of induction, but it can handle some problems where normal induction fails. The procedure is generally like this:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Similarly to usual induction, we first show that $P(i)$ is true for some natural number $i$, usually 0 or 1.

        \item We then show that if $P(n)$ is true, $P(2n)$ must also be true.

        \item Finally we show that if $P(n)$ is true, $P(n - 1)$ must also be true.
    \end{enumerate}
    You can see why this technique is called forward - backward induction. We use step 2 to skip over a chunk of numbers, and then use step 3 to show that $P$ is also true for the numbers that we skipped. You can read more about this technique \href{https://brilliant.org/wiki/forward-backwards-induction/}{here}.
