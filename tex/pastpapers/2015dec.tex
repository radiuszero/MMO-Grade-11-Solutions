    \problem The operation $\triangle$ is defined as $a \otriangle b = ab + 2a +
    b$. Find $x$, if $\frac{12}{6 - x} \otriangle 2 = 3 \otriangle 5$.

    \problem Let $p$ and $q$ be the remainders when the polynomials $f(x) = x^3
    + 2x^2 - 5ax - 7$ and $g(x) = x^3 + ax^2 - 12x + 6$ are divided by $x + 1$
    and $x - 2$ respecively. If $2p + q = 6$, find the value of $a$.

    \problem Prove that $(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) \geq 8abc$ for any $a, b, c \geq
    0$. 

    \problem The point $P$ lies on a circle with radius $r$ which has $AB$ as a
    diameter. Show that $PA \cdot  PB \leq 2r^2$ and $PA + PB \leq 2\sqrt{2}r$.

    \problem In a sequence, $u_{1} = 1$, $u_{2} = 2$ and $u_{3} = 3$. For $n
    \geq 4$, the $n$th term $u_{n}$ is calculated from the previous three terms
    as $u_{n} = u_{n - 3} + u_{n - 2} - u_{n - 1}$. For example, $u_{4} = u_{1}
    + u_{2} - u_{3} = 0$. Write down the first 9 terms. What is the 2015th term
    of the sequence?

    \problem In the figure, a square $ABCD$ of side length 6 is given. Two
    circles with diameters $AD$ and $CD$ are drawn. Determine the combined area
    of two shaded regions.

    \problem In $\triangle ABC$, $\angle A = 90^\circ$. The point $P$ lies
    inside $\triangle ABC$ with distances from $AB$, $BC$ and $CA$ equal to $x$,
    $y$ and $z$ respectively. If we denote $a = BC$, $b = CA$ and $c = AB$, show
    that 
    \[ z = \frac{bc - cx - ay}{b}. \]

    \problem An integer is chosen from the set $\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}$. Find
    the probability that the integer is divisible by 3 or 7.

    \problem Aung Aung says to Bo Bo, ``I am 5 times what you were when I was
    your age''.  The sum of their current ages is 64. Find their ages.

    \problem The sum of squares of three consecutive positive integers is 2 more
    than 100 times the sum of the numbers itself. Find the largest of the three
    numbers.

    \problem $P$ and $Q$ are two points on $AB$ and $AC$ respectively, of
    $\triangle ABC$. If $PQ$ is parallel to $BC$, and bisects $\triangle ABC$,
    find $AP : PB$.

    \problem Find the remainder when $(x + 1)^{2016} + (x + 2)^{2016}$ is
    divided by $x^2 + 3x + 2$.

    \problem If $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ are in harmonic progression, prove that $ab +
    bc + cd = 3ad$.

    \problem Using mathematical induction, prove that 
    \[1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \frac{n(n + 1)(2n + 1)}{6}.\]

    \problem Show that $n^7 - n$ is divisible by 42, for all positive integers
    $n$.

    \problem If $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are roots of the equation $x^3 +
    px^2 + qx + k = 0$, show that $\alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^2 = p^2 - 2q$.
