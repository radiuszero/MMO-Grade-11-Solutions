    \problem Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, $a \ne 0$. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Fill in the following steps ($\square$) to show that $f(x) = a(x
            + \frac{b}{2a})^2 - \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{2a}$. 
        \begin{align*}
            f(x) &= a(x^2 + \square x) + c\\
            &= a\left(x^2 + \square x + \square - \left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2\right) + c\\
            &= a(x^2 + \square x + \square)- \frac{b^2}{\square} + c\\
            &= a(x + \square)^2 - \frac{b^2}{\square} + c\\
            &= a\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a}
        \end{align*}
        
        \item Hence show that if $a > 0$ and $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then $f(x) > 0$
            for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. 
        
        \item Show that if $a < 0$ and $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, then $f(x) < 0$ for all
            $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
        
        \item If $b^2 - 4ac > 0$, find the roots of the equation $f(x) = 0$ in
            terms of $a$, $b$ and $c$.

    random, one at a time but not replaced, until all 3 of red balls are drawn
    or until both green balls are drawn. What is the probability that the 3
    reds are drawn? 
    
    \problem If 75! is divisible by $5^n$, find the maximum value of $n$.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Prove that $n \leq -k^2 + nk + k \leq \frac{(n + 1)^2}{4}$ for $1
            \leq k \leq n$. 
        
        \item Consider $k(n + 1 - k) = -k^2 + nk + k$ and by using the
            inequalities in (1), prove that \[n^n \leq (n!)^2 \leq \frac{(n +
            1)^{2n}}{4^n}.\]
        
        \item Hence prove that \[n^{\frac{n}{2}} \leq n! \leq \frac{(n +
